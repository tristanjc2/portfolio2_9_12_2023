React Portfolio #2, 
Design from @howtobecomeadeveloper on YouTube.

Built without api for EmailJS, and not deployed the demo projects have not been incorporated they are still default. 
I would like to build more of these to obtain more knowledge on React and Django, practicing my skills while learning at the same time.

Eventually would like to develop the necessary skills to build a beautiful fully functional portfolio design incorporating three.js and stunning 3D rendering effects.
